Here are the steps to create a Python virtual environment inside Ubuntu for WSL:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment.
2. Run the following command to install pip:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

3. Run the following command to install virtualenv:

```
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

4. Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:

```
virtualenv venv
```

5. Activate the virtual environment by running:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

6. You should now see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt, indicating that you are working inside the virtual environment.

You can now install any packages you need inside this virtual environment using pip.
